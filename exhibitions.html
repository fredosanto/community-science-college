                  Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                  'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see
                  and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the
                  various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
                  a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel
                  by.

              <div class="grid_content">
                <p>
                  For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                  the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                  we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                  have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                  in this world.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                  species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take
                  some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive,
                  including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                  dinosaurs too.

                <p>
                  For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                  quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                  understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we
                  explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                  breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                  first heart transplant.

                <br />
                <p>
                  Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only
                  from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
                  Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                  The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial

                  applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future

                  As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on
                  the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists
                  explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans
                  but for the whole planet.

                  In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                  currently face including global warming, extinction of
                  species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways
                  we can all contribute to a brighter future.
