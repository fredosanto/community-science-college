                  Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're
                  committed to making science accessible to all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the course of human history, science has developed from
                  our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to
                  exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very
                  building blocks of life itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
                  experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even
                  ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the
                  world around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
                  brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over
                  1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science
                  to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to
                  interact with and play around to see science come to life
                  (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at
                  night when everyone's gone home).

                  <p>
                    A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep
                    the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come
                    and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to
                    see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to
                    staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and
                    volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future
                    exhibits and strategies for the museum.

                  <p>
                    You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres.
                    Please contact us if you'd like to find out more about how
                    you can get involved.
